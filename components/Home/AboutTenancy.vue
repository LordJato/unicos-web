Secured Data Multitenancy Statement
Our web applications are designed with multitenancy architecture, ensuring the highest level of data security and isolation. Each tenant's data is logically segregated and encrypted, providing a secure and reliable environment for our users. Our multitenancy approach ensures:
Data Confidentiality: Each tenant's data is accessible only to authorized personnel.
Data Integrity: Regular backups and versioning prevent data loss or tampering.
Data Availability: Scalable infrastructure ensures high uptime and accessibility.
Compliance: Adherence to international data protection standards and regulations.</div>
